## 2. Prepare

### Data Source:
The data used is the **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** from Kaggle (CC0: Public Domain). It's a public dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk, containing data from thirty Fitbit users.

### Data Organization and Verification:
The dataset is stored in 18 CSV files. I used R to explore the data, checking for missing values, duplicates, and errors. The data was found to be generally reliable, but the small sample size (30 users) is a limitation.

### Data Cleaning Steps:

## 6. Act: Recommendations for Bellabeat

Based on the analysis, here are three recommendations for Bellabeat's marketing team:

1.  **Focus on Mid-day Motivation:** Since users are most active in the evening, Bellabeat could create marketing campaigns and app notifications that encourage short, mid-day walks or activities to break up sedentary time.
2.  **Market Sleep Benefits:** Highlight how Bellabeat's sleep tracking features can help users improve their sleep, which is directly correlated with higher activity levels.
3.  **Launch Weekend Wellness Challenges:** Since activity patterns might differ on weekends, Bellabeat could use its app to launch fun challenges to keep users engaged and moving.
